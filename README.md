### A game I made in 12th grade, includes a generalized algorithm for parsing .OBJ files and rendering their contents as 3D models through the GLUT openGL library

Feel free to compile it and run it on your own system if you like, the binaries for windows are in the bin/Debug folder, named modelrender.exe
